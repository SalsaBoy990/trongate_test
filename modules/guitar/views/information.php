    <p>The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele, is, an
        electric guitar produced by Fender. Together with its sister model the
        Esquire, it is the world's first mass-produced, commercially successful
        solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and
        revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar
        manufacturing and popular music.</p>

    <p>Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the
        autumn of 1950 as a two-pickup version of its sister model, the
        single-pickup Esquire, the pair were the first guitars of their kind
        manufactured on a substantial scale. A trademark conflict with a rival
        manufacturer (Gretsch Broadkaster) led to the guitar being renamed in
        1951. Initially, the Broadcaster name was simply cut off of the labels
        placed on the guitars (leading to a limited run of nameless guitars known
        as "No-casters") and later in 1951, the final name of Telecaster was
        applied to the guitar to take advantage of the advent of television. The
        Telecaster quickly became a popular model, and has remained in
        continuous production since its first incarnation.</p>
